# Learning Fuze Class Agenda

## Technologies: React.js, Redux, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3

#### Description

This user-interactive application was built for Learning Fuze (Web Development School) that allows students to dynamically view calendar events. It utilizes SuperAgent to get network requests and update live event data from the Google Calendar API. This information is then parsed and processed with Redux to dispatch relevant event information across components. One of the cool features of this app include a virtual user-interface programmed in React utilizing Leap Motionâ€™s hand tracking technology to control navigation using gestures.
